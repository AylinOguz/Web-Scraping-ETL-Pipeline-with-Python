# Web-Scraping-ETL-Pipeline-with-Python

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline built with Python.
It scrapes data from a public website, cleans and transforms the data, then saves it into a CSV file and an SQLite database.
It also includes a logging system to track each step of the pipeline.
